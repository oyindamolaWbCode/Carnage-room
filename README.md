# Carnage-room
Analyzing the malicious network traffic using Wireshark

Carnage is a TryHackMe room (machine) focused on practical offensive skills — enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation.
This repository contains my methodology, commands used on the TryHackMe AttackBox (no external VM required), and artefacts to reproduce the steps.

Note: I executed every step from TryHackMe’s AttackBox / provided machine, not a local VM. Where applicable, I included the exact commands and example outputs (redacted where needed).
